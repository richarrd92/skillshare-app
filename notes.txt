    - WHEN TO ADD AND KEEP DUMMY 
        - Only if you‚Äôre documenting or mocking structure without loading data.
        - If this is schema-only SQL meant to be forked/filled later.
    - WHEN NOT ADD AND KEEP DUMMY 
        - You're populating production data
            - Uploaded profile image links (e.g., from Firebase Storage, S3, Cloudinary)
            - CDN-hosted public links
        - You're working on staging/dev and want realistic content
            - Use placeholder image services for safe dummy data:

==> APP FEATURE IDEAS

- Streaks / Activity Points System:
    - Reward consistency in posting or engaging with matches.
    - Streak-based features (e.g., ‚Äú3-day poster‚Äù gets profile boost).

- Hobby Events or Meetups - Something like a snapchat map to see trending spots:
    - Users can create virtual/in-person events for specific hobbies.
    - RSVP system.
    - Optional group chat for each event.

- Connection History / Friend System:
    - See a list of users you‚Äôve matched or interacted with.
    - Send follow-up connection requests.
    - Maybe show last active or current streaks.

- Reactions or Comments on 24hr Posts:
    - Lightweight interaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è üëç üî•
    - Optionally allow short comments (with moderation).

--Additional thoughts:

- You might want an index on expires_at to efficiently query active posts.
- You could add a "likes" or "comments" feature later if desired.
- The app backend should have a scheduled cleanup job or just filter out expired posts dynamically.

- Limiting posts per day per user ‚Äî and here‚Äôs why:
    - Prevent spam: Avoid clutter or abuse of the feature.
    - Maintain quality: Encourages users to be intentional about what they share.
    - Simplifies recommendations: Easier to select "the best post" per user for the day.
    - Aligns with ephemeral nature: If the posts disappear after 24 hours, one post/day keeps it meaningful.

- Optional Premium/Niche Features
    - Age-based filters for minors/adults.
    - Verified users (photo or platform verification).
    - Private mode ‚Äî post and explore without appearing in matches.
    - Voice intros or short videos on profile.
